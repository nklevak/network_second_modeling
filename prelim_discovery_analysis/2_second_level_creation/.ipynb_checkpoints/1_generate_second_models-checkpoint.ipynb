    "Cleaned up coding pipeline for the discovery sample exploratory analyses. \n",

    "1_generate_second_model.ipynb loads in the first level contrast maps for all task/contrasts for each of the 5 discovery sample subjects. Then, it generates second level models (for each task/contrast, it creates 1 second level model for each encounter of the task). For example, since every subject has 5 sessions with a given task--although the specific session numbers are different--the subjects get combined for their first encounter of a given task, then the next model combines them for their second encounter of a given task, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "These second level models are then saved in the home directory: '/home/users/nklevak/network_data_updated/' under each specific task name folder (i.e. cuedTS, directedForgetting, flanker, goNogo, nBack, shapeMatching, spatialTS, stopSignal) and then the corresponding contrast folder. Filename format is: {taskName}_{contrastName}encounter{encounter_number}. The encounter numbers range from 1-5."
